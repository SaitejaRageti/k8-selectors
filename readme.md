NODE-SELECTOR:
--------------------------

In Kubernetes (K8s), a Node Selector is a simple way to constrain a Pod to only run on particular Nodes.
It works by matching key-value labels assigned to Nodes.

👉 Think of it like:

You label Nodes with some attributes (e.g., disktype=ssd, region=us-east).

You then tell your Pod/Deployment spec to use a nodeSelector so that the Pod only schedules onto matching Nodes.

🔹 Example
Step 1: Label a node

In Kubernetes (K8s), a Node Selector is a simple way to constrain a Pod to only run on particular Nodes.
It works by matching key-value labels assigned to Nodes.

👉 Think of it like:

You label Nodes with some attributes (e.g., disktype=ssd, region=us-east).

You then tell your Pod/Deployment spec to use a nodeSelector so that the Pod only schedules onto matching Nodes.

🔹 Example
Step 1: Label a node

<!-- ----- >> kubectl label nodes worker-node-1 disktype=ssd -->


This adds a label disktype=ssd to worker-node-1.

Step 2: Pod with nodeSelector

Here’s a sample Pod manifest that uses a nodeSelector:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd


The Pod will only be scheduled on nodes labeled with disktype=ssd.

If no such node exists, the Pod will stay in a Pending state until a matching node is available

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAINTS -TOLERATION
------------------
In Kubernetes, taints and tolerations are another way (more advanced than nodeSelector) to control which Pods can or cannot run on which Nodes.

🔹 What are Taints?

Taint is applied to a Node.

It means: “Don’t schedule Pods here unless they explicitly tolerate this taint.”

Think of it as repelling Pods unless they have permission.

A taint has 3 parts:

key=value:effect


key and value are labels you choose.

effect can be:

<!-- NoSchedule → Pods that don’t tolerate this taint will not be scheduled on the node.

PreferNoSchedule → Scheduler tries to avoid the node, but not guaranteed.

NoExecute → Existing Pods that don’t tolerate will be evicted, and new ones won’t be scheduled. -->

🔹 What are Tolerations?

Toleration is applied to a Pod.

It means: “I’m okay to be scheduled on a Node that has this taint.”

Without a matching toleration, the Pod will be kept away from tainted nodes.

🔹 Example: Taint + Toleration
1. Add a taint to a Node

Suppose you want only certain workloads (e.g., GPU jobs) to run on a node:

<!-- kubectl taint nodes node1 dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule -->


Now node1 has a taint:

dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule


This means:

No Pods will be scheduled on this node unless they tolerate this taint.

2. Pod with a matching toleration

Here’s a Pod YAML that tolerates the taint:

<!-- apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: gpu-container
      image: nvidia/cuda:12.2.0
  tolerations:
    - key: "dedicated"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "gpu"
      effect: "NoSchedule" -->


➡️ This Pod has a toleration for the taint (dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule), so it can be scheduled on node1.

3. Pod without a toleration

If you deploy a Pod without that toleration, it will not be scheduled on node1.

✅ Summary:

<!-- nodeSelector = positive matching ("only run me on nodes with this label").

Taints & tolerations = negative matching ("don’t run anything here unless it tolerates"). -->
